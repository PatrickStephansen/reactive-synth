# ReactiveSynth

A modular synth that runs in the broswer. The live version is hosted at https://patrickstephansen.github.io/reactive-synth/.

The project was started as an exercise to learn [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/).

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

Run `npm run deploy` to publish the build artefacts in `dist` to https://patrickstephansen.github.io/reactive-synth/.
